# Elara – Financial Freedom for Women

## Project Overview
Elara is a financial empowerment platform designed to help women in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) build wealth, gain financial confidence, and achieve economic independence.

2. **Micro-Education Modules:** 2–5 minute lessons on investing, budgeting, and financial confidence.
3. **Daily News Feed:** Simple, actionable financial insights relevant to women.
4. **Financial Therapy Assistant (AI Copilot):** AI-driven tool to help women overcome financial anxiety and emotional money blocks.
5. **Elara Goals Hub:** Personalized financial goals – from Break-Up Fund to First Home and Career Pivot.
